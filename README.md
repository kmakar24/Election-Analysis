##Election-Audit Summary 
This is just one example of how this script can be used, you can take the script and make some modifications to use it for any election.  All you have to do is import the results of any election and then change the variables to match the variables in the newly imported election results. For example if it is for a country wide election you would change county to states.  You could even use it for a high school election result changing cunty to grade level.
